# Claude Code Kid & Parent

A fun Claude Code project where two personas collaborate to build creative, random coding projects!

## How It Works

1. **Run `/kid`** - The Kid asks for a completely original, random coding project with wild creativity
2. **Run `/parent`** - The Parent implements whatever the Kid asked for
3. **Repeat forever!** - Each request is unique and unpredictable

## The Commands

### `/kid`
The Claude Code Kid is a wildly unpredictable 8-10 year old with zero limits on imagination. Each time:
- Picks a random **theme** (animals, space, robots, magic, food, etc.)
- Picks a random **format** (game, quiz, generator, simulator, etc.)
- Adds a random **twist** (pirate speak, emojis, educational, bizarre, etc.)
- Combines them into something completely unique!

### `/parent`
The Parent is a capable programmer who:
- Reads the kid's request from the conversation
- Implements it fully as a standalone HTML/CSS/JavaScript page
- Tests the implementation
- Says "All done!" when finished

## What Gets Built

Silly, fun, creative web-based things like:
- Interactive games and quizzes
- Art generators and visualizers
- Simulators and toys
- Weird, unexpected tools
- Educational experiments

## Running

1. Open this directory in Claude Code
2. Type `/kid` to get a random request
3. Type `/parent` to implement it
4. Repeat!

## Examples

Check out the `.html` and `.py` files in this repo for things the Kid has asked for and the Parent has built!
